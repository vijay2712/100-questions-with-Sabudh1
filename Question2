#Three Number Sum
#Write a function that takes in a non empty array of distinct integers and an integer 
#representing a target sum. 
#The function should find a list of triplets in the array that sum upto the target sum and
#return a two-dimensional array of all the these triplets.
#The numbers in each triplet should be order in ascending order, and the triplets themselves 
#should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold.

#If no three numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array.
