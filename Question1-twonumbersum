#Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers

#If no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array. 
#Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integers in the array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.You can assume 
#that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.
